    "This Jupyter Notebook provides exercises to gain experience with optimization and root-finding in Python.  These exercises are intended to extened and reinforce what we learned in the WebEx sessions and in the tutorials posted to the GitHub repo.  Please work these at your own pace, with a group (if you wish), and don't hesitate to ask if you have questions.\n",
